## File Naming Convention

The app looks for these filenames (in order):

2. `mhk_logo.svg` (vector, scales perfectly)
3. `mhk_logo.jpg`
4. `logo.png`
5. `logo.svg`
6. `logo.jpg`

**Just make sure it's named correctly and placed in this folder!**

---

## Recommended Logo Specs

### Best Quality:
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: 200x200 pixels or larger
- **Resolution**: 72-300 DPI
- **Max file size**: 1 MB

### Acceptable:
- **Format**: JPG, SVG, WebP
- **Size**: Any reasonable size (will be auto-scaled)
- **Note**: JPG won't have transparent background

---

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing?

1. **Check filename**: Must be exactly `mhk_logo.png` (case-sensitive)
2. **Check location**: Must be in `backend/assets/` folder
3. **Check file format**: PNG, JPG, or SVG
4. **Restart Streamlit**: Sometimes needs a restart to detect new files

### Logo Too Big/Small?

The app automatically scales logos, but if you need to adjust:

1. Open `streamlit_app_new.py`
2. Find the logo section (around line 100)
3. Adjust the `width` or `height` parameter
