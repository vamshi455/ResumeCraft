# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment - Fixed Configuration

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The deployment error has been fixed! The repository now has the correct configuration for Streamlit Cloud.

---

## 📋 Correct Deployment Settings

Use these **exact settings** in the Streamlit Cloud deployment form:

### **Basic Settings**

```
Repository: vamshi455/ResumeCraft
Branch: main
Main file path: backend/app.py
App URL: resumecraft
```

### **Advanced Settings**

Click "Advanced settings" and configure:

```
Python version: 3.12
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Leave "Requirements file" EMPTY**

Streamlit Cloud will automatically find and use `/requirements.txt` in the root directory (which was just added).

### **Secrets**

In the Secrets section, paste:

```toml
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-your-actual-api-key-here"
```

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
The deployment was failing because:
1. Streamlit Cloud was using `backend/requirements.txt` (FastAPI backend dependencies)
2. This included `psycopg2-binary` and other packages not needed for Streamlit
3. Build failed due to missing PostgreSQL development headers

### Solution
1. ✅ Created `requirements.txt` in **root directory** with only Streamlit dependencies
2. ✅ Created `.streamlit/config.toml` in **root directory** with proper configuration
3. ✅ Pushed changes to GitHub

---

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### 1. Go to Streamlit Cloud
Visit: https://share.streamlit.io/

### 2. Sign in with GitHub

### 3. Click "New app"

### 4. Fill in the form:

**Repository:**
```
vamshi455/ResumeCraft
```

**Branch:**
```
main
```

**Main file path:**
```
backend/app.py
```

**App URL (optional):**
```
resumecraft
```

### 5. Click "Advanced settings"

**Python version:**
```
3.12
```

**⚠️ Requirements file:**
```
(Leave this EMPTY - do not fill anything here)
```

Streamlit will automatically use the `requirements.txt` in the root.

### 6. Add Secrets

Click on "Secrets" and paste:

```toml
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-api03-your-actual-key-here"
```

Replace with your real API key from https://console.anthropic.com/

### 7. Click "Deploy" 🚀

The deployment should now succeed!

## ⏱️ Deployment Timeline

- **Provisioning:** ~10 seconds
- **Installing dependencies:** ~2-3 minutes
- **Starting app:** ~10 seconds
- **Total:** ~3-4 minutes

## ✅ What to Expect

You should see logs like:

```
[UTC] 🖥 Provisioning machine...
[UTC] 🎛 Preparing system...
[UTC] 🚀 Starting up repository: 'resumecraft', branch: 'main'
[UTC] 🐙 Cloning repository...
[UTC] 🐙 Cloned repository!
[UTC] 📦 Processing dependencies...
[UTC] ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
[UTC] 🎉 Your app is live at: https://resumecraft.streamlit.app
```

---

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed, your app will be available at:

```
https://resumecraft.streamlit.app
```
(or whatever URL you chose)

---

## 📱 Deploy Entity Resolution App

To deploy the second app, repeat the process:

### Settings:
```
Repository: vamshi455/ResumeCraft
Branch: main
Main file path: backend/app_entity_resolution.py
App URL: resumecraft-entity
Python version: 3.12
Requirements file: (LEAVE EMPTY)
```

### Secrets:
```toml
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-your-key-here"
```

**Result:**
- Main App: `https://resumecraft.streamlit.app`
- Entity Resolution: `https://resumecraft-entity.streamlit.app`

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:

1. **Check the logs** in Streamlit Cloud for the exact error

2. **Verify branch name** is `main` not `master`

3. **Verify file path** is `backend/app.py` (with the `backend/` prefix)

4. **Ensure secrets are set** with correct TOML format

5. **Try "Reboot app"** in Streamlit Cloud dashboard

6. **Check API key** is valid at https://console.anthropic.com/

### Common Errors:

**"Module not found":**
- The `requirements.txt` in root should handle this
- If still failing, check the package name/version

**"File not found":**
- Verify path is `backend/app.py` not just `app.py`

**"API key missing":**
- Check Secrets section has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set correctly

**"Import error":**
- Wait for dependencies to fully install (takes 2-3 minutes)

## 📊 Files Added to Repository

The following files were added to fix deployment:

1. **`/requirements.txt`** - Streamlit Cloud dependencies (root level)
2. **`/.streamlit/config.toml`** - Streamlit configuration (root level)

These work alongside existing files:
- `/backend/requirements_streamlit.txt` (for other platforms)
- `/backend/requirements.txt` (for FastAPI backend)

## 🎯 Summary

**What you need to do NOW:**

1. ✅ Code is already pushed to GitHub (just done)
2. 🔄 **Go back to Streamlit Cloud**
3. 🗑️ **Delete the failed deployment** (if it exists)
4. ➕ **Create a new deployment** with the settings above
5. ⚠️ **Leave "Requirements file" EMPTY** in Advanced settings
6. 🚀 **Deploy!**

The deployment should now work successfully! 🎉
