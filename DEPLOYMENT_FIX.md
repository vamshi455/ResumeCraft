# 🎯 STREAMLIT CLOUD DEPLOYMENT - FINAL FIX

## ✅ Issue RESOLVED!

### The Problem
Streamlit Cloud was using `backend/requirements.txt` (FastAPI dependencies) instead of root `requirements.txt` (Streamlit dependencies).

### The Solution
**Renamed** `backend/requirements.txt` → `backend/requirements-fastapi.txt`

Now Streamlit Cloud will use the correct root `requirements.txt`!

## 📂 Current File Structure

```
ResumeCraft/
├── requirements.txt                    ← ✅ Streamlit will use THIS
├── .streamlit/
│   └── config.toml                     ← ✅ Streamlit config
└── backend/
    ├── app.py                          ← Main app
    ├── app_entity_resolution.py        ← Entity Resolution app
    ├── requirements-fastapi.txt        ← FastAPI (renamed, ignored by Streamlit)
    └── requirements_streamlit.txt      ← Backup/reference
```

## 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Settings (FINAL)

### Basic Settings
```
Repository: vamshi455/ResumeCraft
Branch: main
Main file path: backend/app.py
App URL: resumecraft
```

## ✅ What Will Happen Now

When you deploy (or it auto-redeploys):

1. ✅ Clones repository
2. ✅ Finds `/requirements.txt` (root)
3. ✅ Installs ONLY Streamlit dependencies
4. ✅ No FastAPI, no psycopg2, no errors!
5. ✅ App deploys successfully

## 📊 Expected Logs

```
🚀 Starting up repository...
🐙 Cloning repository...
📦 Processing dependencies...
✅ Installing streamlit==1.31.0
✅ Installing langchain-anthropic==0.1.9
✅ Installing pandas==2.2.0
✅ Installing openpyxl==3.1.2
✅ All dependencies installed
🎉 Your app is live at: https://resumecraft.streamlit.app
```

---

## 🔄 Auto-Redeploy Status

If your app is already created on Streamlit Cloud, it should **auto-redeploy now** (detecting the latest push).

Watch your Streamlit Cloud dashboard for:
- "🔄 Redeploying..." notification
- Build logs showing successful dependency installation
- "✅ App is running" status

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### If App Exists on Streamlit Cloud:
✅ Wait 2-3 minutes for auto-redeploy
✅ Check dashboard for successful deployment
✅ Visit your app URL

### If Creating New App:
✅ Use the settings above
✅ Deploy!
✅ Should work perfectly now

## 📱 Deploy Entity Resolution Too

Same settings, just change:
```
Main file path: backend/app_entity_resolution.py
App URL: resumecraft-entity
```

**The fix is pushed! Your deployment should succeed now!** 🎉
